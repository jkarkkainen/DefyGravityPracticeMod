# Defy Gravity Practice Mod
This is a practice modification for Defy Gravity, to practice individual levels for speedrunning. Contains also other fixes, that might be useful to all players.

Currently the best way to fix the slowdown (even if you don't have the slowdown, you should be using this) is to just enable F1, and keep the rest disabled. However, in case the framerate doesn't stay stable at 60fps, you will see a red bullet bill in the top-right corner of the game. This means your game is running faster or slower than 60 fps, and you should either disable slowdown fixes, or use the F2 slowdown fix with any combination of F1 and F3.

PS. Speedruns are not accepted if the red bullet bill shows up for the most of the run.
